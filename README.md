# Inv-App

This application serves to track inventory, sales and inventory orders for any industry. 

## Description

This application allows the user to sort your inventory by suppliers and categories. The application has the capabilities to edit and delete these suppliers and categories. When a product is added to the inventory a supplier and category is assigned to it. Products that are added to the inventory are able to be edited and deleted as well. The application also allows the user to record sales and view a list of past sales. Suppliers, categories, and products, and inventory orders are displayed in their own catalogs. On opening, the app requires the user to sign in or create a new account. If the user registers themselves successfully, they will get a message stating so. Once in the app, you are able to add users to the system as well. To add a supplier, category or product the application gathers information from the user and addsit to the respective catalog.

## Motivation
The motivation behind this project was to be able to develop a dependable app that a professional company could use to keep track of their inventory, inventory orders, and sales. To effectively manage the dabatase, suppliers, categories, sales and produccts all have ID numbers. Through the ID number, the dabatase identifies the object, and edits it as needed.
